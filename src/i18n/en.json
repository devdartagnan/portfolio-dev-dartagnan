        "about": "My name is Leonardo and I'm a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for design. Although I don't have any work experience yet, I have been honing my skills by working on various personal projects. One of the things that I love about front-end development is how it allows me to blend my interests in art and games. I see web development as a form of digital art that can be used to create engaging and immersive experiences for users. I strive to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and easy to use. When I'm not coding, I can usually be found exploring the latest video games or attending local art exhibitions. I find that both of these hobbies inspire me to think creatively and approach my work from different angles. Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects as much as I enjoyed creating them"
